ANIMATION
To run the animation, type:
"%run animation {dimensions of lattice (e.g. 50)} {temperature (e.g. 3)} {dynamics (Glauber/Kawasaki)} {number of steps/sweeps} {frequency of animation}"

DATA WITH ERRORS
Produces txt data files (named 'GlauberTest.txt' and 'KawasakiTest.txt') containing data for the graphs. 

Note: However, the data files I have already produced by running the code are named 'Glauber.txt' and 'Kawasaki.txt', in the folder 'Data files'.

READ IN GRAPHS FROM DATA
Reads in the data from the txt files and produces the graphs

Note: The Kawasaki files/graphs also include magnetization and susceptibility to show they are zero
