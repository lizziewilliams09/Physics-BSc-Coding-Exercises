# BSc Short Coding Exercises

This repository contains a collection of coding tasks and numerical exercises completed during my BSc in Theoretical Physics (2020–2024). Each task is provided either as a Jupyter notebook (with explanations, background, and results documented in the markdown cells) or as a folder containing multiple Python scripts along with a dedicated README. The purpose of this repository is to showcase the coding, simulation, and computational physics skills I developed throughout my undergraduate studies.

## Excersizes

* **Baseballs in Flight** – Simulates batted baseball trajectories under gravity, drag, and spin using Python's `solve_ivp` for numerical integration. Includes Monte Carlo sampling to explore variability in initial speed, angle, and spin, demonstrating physics-based modelling and stochastic simulation.

* **Harmonics of a Square Wave** – Analyses a square wave using Fourier decomposition, fitting sine and cosine components to reconstruct the signal. Uses least-squares fitting and linear algebra (`numpy`, `scipy.linalg`) to extract amplitudes and phases, showcasing practical signal processing and data modelling.

## Usage

* Each notebook can be executed independently.
* Markdown cells provide explanations, derivations, and interpretations of results.
