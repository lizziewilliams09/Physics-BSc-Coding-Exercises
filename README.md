# Physics-BSc-Coding-Exercises

This repository contains a collection of small coding tasks and numerical exercises undertaken throughout my BSc in Theoretical Physics (2020–2024). Each task is contained in its own Jupyter notebook, with explanations, background, and results documented in the markdown cells. The purpose of this repo is to showcase the coding and computational physics skills I developed during my undergraduate degree.

## Notebooks

* **Baseballs in Flight** – Simulates batted baseball trajectories under gravity, drag, and spin using Python's `solve_ivp` for numerical integration. Includes Monte Carlo sampling to explore variability in initial speed, angle, and spin, demonstrating physics-based modelling and stochastic simulation.

* **Harmonics of a Square Wave** – Analyses a square wave using Fourier decomposition, fitting sine and cosine components to reconstruct the signal. Uses least-squares fitting and linear algebra (`numpy`, `scipy.linalg`) to extract amplitudes and phases, showcasing practical signal processing and data modelling.

## Usage

* Each notebook can be executed independently.
* Python packages required: `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas` (if data handling is needed).
* Markdown cells provide explanations, derivations, and interpretations of results.
